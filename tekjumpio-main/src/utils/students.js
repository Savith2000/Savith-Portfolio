The teacher, Dan, is exceptional, and I believe he is one of the best teachers I have ever had. I am having so much fun during Phase 2 of the course working with my peers and Dan to build some of the coolest projects and webpages I have seen.",

I learned so much in the span of three months and the instructor of the camp,Dan, taught very well, and explained everything in a simple and easy way. When I first started camp, I looked through the material that we were going to learn and was feeling overwhelmed. But throughout the course, there were many exercises and tools that helped me fully understand everything I was doing. This is and always will be one of the best courses I have ever taken.",

The camp focuses on popular web technologies and encourages creativity, questions, and thinking outside the box. Wether you code as a hobby or want to pursue software as a career, you will be prepared to continue learning and writing software outside of class.",
